Github is used from the beginner students to the master programmers to the organization. Everyone is on GitHub. 

**What's GitHub?**

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git combined with a unique set of other features.

An indispensable tool in modern software development is some kind of version control system. Version control systems allow you to keep track of your software at the source level. You can track changes, revert to previous stages, and branch to create alternate versions of files and directories. One of the most popular version control systems is **git**, a distributed version control system. Many projects maintain their files in a git repository, and sites like GitHub and Bitbucket have made sharing and contributing to code simple and valuable.

In layman's terms, it's a place where every developer (or aspiring developer) can share their source code and stories with the world. It's a huge and highly respected collaboration platform, and it's used by just about every big technology company you can think of: Google, Twitter, Mozilla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Dropbox, and PayPal, to name a few. So, why did they all choose GitHub?

**It's the place to store your code**

Let's be honestâ€”if you're not hosting your source code on GitHub right now, your open source project pretty much doesn't exist. I have a lot of respect for solutions like Launchpad and BitBucket, but GitHub is still the place to go if you need a place to store and share your source code.

So, there are certain steps youcan follow to understand the workflow of GitHub :

     Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account
     
     Step 1: Create a local git repository 
     
     Step 2: Add a new file to the repo
     
     Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment
     
     Step 4: Create a commit
     
     Step 5: Create a new branch
     
     Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub
     
     Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub
     
     Step 8: Create a Pull Request (PR)
     
     Step 9: Merge a PR
     
     Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer
     
     Step 11: Bask in your git glory
     
**Amazing support**

I'm a developer. I use lots of stable and unstable software and services on a daily basis, and it's important that I get support as fast as possible. I once had an issue with a GitHub feature and reached out to them for support. I received an email response within 20 minutes. Support was eventually able to explain exactly why I was having the issue and what I had to do to resolve it. I have to give them a straight 10/10 for their support.
